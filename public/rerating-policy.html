1. Purpose of the Policy
The PhantomID Rating Re-evaluation Policy exists to ensure that all competitive ratings remain fair, accurate, and representative of a player’s current competitive level.
PhantomID ratings are designed to reflect long-term performance and credibility, not short-term peaks or isolated results.

2. Eligibility for Re-evaluation
Every registered PhantomID player is eligible to request one (1) rating re-evaluation per calendar year.


Unused re-evaluation requests do not carry over to the following year.


Requests submitted outside the allowed frequency will be automatically declined.



3. Conditions for Submitting a Request
A re-evaluation request may be submitted if the player can reasonably demonstrate:
Significant improvement in competitive performance


Consistent results in official or recognized tournaments


Advancement to higher-level competitive environments


Sustained performance over time (not isolated events)


PhantomID reserves the right to reject requests that do not meet these conditions.

4. Evaluation Process
All rating re-evaluations are manually reviewed by the PhantomID team.
The evaluation may include, but is not limited to:
Tournament results and placements


Level and credibility of competitions played


Match statistics and performance consistency


Competitive history recorded on PhantomID


Overall impact and reputation within the competitive scene


No automated system is used for rating changes.

5. Possible Outcomes
Following a review, one of the following decisions will be issued:
✅ Rating Upgrade – The player’s rating is increased.


🔁 Rating Confirmation – The current rating remains unchanged.


⬇️ Rating Adjustment – In rare cases, a rating may be lowered if the current rank is deemed inaccurate.


All decisions are final and not subject to appeal.

6. Transparency & Notification
Players will be notified once the evaluation process is completed.


PhantomID does not disclose internal scoring formulas or evaluation weights.


Detailed justifications are not guaranteed for every decision.



7. System Integrity & Abuse Prevention
To protect the integrity of the PhantomID ecosystem:
Rating manipulation attempts will result in request denial.


False or misleading information may lead to penalties or account action.


PhantomID reserves the right to suspend re-evaluation privileges if abuse is detected.



8. PhantomID Authority
PhantomID maintains full authority over:
Rating definitions


Evaluation criteria


Final decisions regarding player ratings


This policy may be updated at any time to maintain fairness and competitive integrity.
